									The easiest way to get to the venue is by car. Deception Pass State Park is about 2 hours north of SeaTac airport. If you are planning to take the Whidbey Island ferry, please note that there can be up to a three hour delay during the summer months.
								</p>
								<p class="section-content">
									Parking for the wedding is located at the East Cranberry Lake parking lot at Deception Pass State Park. The parking lot is located a little less than a mile from the venue. We will have a passenger shuttle to bring people from the parking lot to the venue. If you are staying overnight at the cabins, please stop by the venue first to drop off your bags and pick up your overnight parking pass. If you are not staying overnight, you will need to purchase a Discover Pass (10$) to park for the day, which are availible at the entrance to the parking lot.
								</p>
								<p class="section-content">
									If you are driving from Seattle/SeaTac and have room in your car, please post on the rideshare Facebook group!
								</p>
								<h2 class="section-heading"> Alternatives </h2>
								<p class="section-content">
								There is an airport shuttle which drops off in the nearby town of Anacortes run by <a href=http://www.airporter.com/>Belair Charters</a>.
									There is also an Amtrak train from Seattle to Mount Vernon, which is another affordable option.
									We have set up a rideshare <a href=https://www.facebook.com/groups/413694525669794/>Facebook group</a>, please post if you are looking for a ride to the venue
								</p>
								<p class="section-content">
									If you are planning on taking the shuttle or the train, please email us to coordinate your pickup and local transportation to the park

                                There are enough cabins on site for anyone who would like to stay with us. The cabins themselves are rustic, summer camp style – if you ever went to a sleepaway camp as a kid, you’ll know exactly what to expect! The cabins have electricity, outlets, and are heated, but bathrooms and showers are shared in centrally located buildings. Cellphone reception at the venue is spotty. 
                                </p>
								<p class="section-content">
								We will provide linens (sheet, blanket, pillow, and a towel) for each guest staying on-site. Basic toiletries like shampoo and tooth paste will be availible in the communal bathrooms.
								</p>
								<p class="section-content">
								Most cabins sleep 10 people. If you would like to stay with a specific group, please email us at <a href=mailto:bobandkeavy@gmail.com>bobandkeavy@gmail.com</a> and we will do our best to accomodate requests. Otherwise, if you have marked that you would like to stay in the cabins on your RSVP, we will assign you to a cabin of our choice.
								</p>
								<p class="section-content">
								Guests staying overnight will need a special parking pass. Please be sure to pick yours up at the venue before parking at the East Cranberry Lake parking lot.

                                century as part of the Civilian Conservation Corps. Cornet Bay retains much of its
                                rich history by maintaining original buildings, hiking trails and vistas.

                        <p class="section-content">
                        Bob and Keavy first met online -- OKCupid, to be specific. Bob messaged first. Keavy was intimidated by his artfully crafted profile that just oozed "too cool." But he managed to seal the deal for a first date with a promise of artisanal pickles.
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-content">
                        On that first date they realized they shared a childhood dream of living in a tiny house on a bridge. For Keavy, it was the Murray Morgan Bridge in Tacoma; Bob's was on the Burlington-Bristol Bridge. They knew they had something special together.
                        </p>
                        <p class="section-content">
                        Since then, they've moved three times (and counting), adopted two insane cats, and visited Scotland and Mexico -- two countries where only Keavy could speak the language. They've traveled cross-country by train, and spent countless hours playing complicated board games. They're looking forward to a lifetime of adventure together and can't wait to celebrate with family and friends.
